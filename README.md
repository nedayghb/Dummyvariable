1	Linear Reg	"1-train model, 
handle missing data,salary is target. 
predict for 
2 yr experience, 9 test score, 6 interview score
12 yr experience, 10 test score, 10 interview score
store result as a text file"
	data1(Data for Task0)
##Cost Function
	"2-find values for coefficient , learning rate,. stop algoritem when relative cost in  two sequence iteration be 1e-20,  then return coefficient and intercept  hint: use math.isclose(cost, cost_previous, rel_tol=1e-20)"
	data2(Data for Task0)
	Save and Load Model
##	"3-implement the same code that we  used  in single variable linear reg
save the model using pickle module  then load the model using pickle do the same thing using joblib
tell me the diffrence between pickle and joblib(check documentation)"""
##	Dummy Variables
	"4-use pandas to create dummy variables and save it into dummies.
now tell me what is Dumm  Variable Trap and how to avoid that?
concatinate dummies to orginal data   frame and drop extra column
save csv file"
